              BENGALURU : A special court for elected representatives on
              Wednesday remanded HD Revana, JD(S) MLA from Holenarsispur and son
              of ex-PM HD Deve Gowda, in judicial custody for a week over
              abduction charges registered against him by KR Nagar police in
              Mysuru. Revana, the first member from the Deve Gowda family to be
              arrested and lodged in jail in a criminal case, was in tears as he
              stepped out of the courteroom, before being bundled off directly
              to the Central Jail on the southeastern fringes of the city.

            Stormy Daniels To Return To Witness Stand At Trump's Historic Hush

              Stormy Daniels is to return to the witness stand on Thursday at
              Donald Trump's historic hush money trial for another round of
              expected tough grilling by attorneys for the former president. The
              X-rated film actress, who claims to have had sex with the married
              Trump in 2006, spent nearly five hours testifying on Tuesday,
              recounting the incident in often explicit detail as the real
              estate tycoon sat stewing just feet away. Trump, 77, is accused of
              falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael
              Cohen, for a $130,000 payment made to Daniels on the eve of the
              2016 presidential election.

            Japan Grapples With 9 Million Empty Homes, More Than The Population
            Of New York

              Japan is confronting a significant problem with vacant houses,
              reaching a record of nine million - exceeding the population of
              New York City. This surge is directly linked to the country's
              declining population, according to a report by CNN. Traditionally,
              abandoned houses, known as "akiya," were found primarily in rural
              areas. However, the trend is spreading to major cities like Tokyo
              and Kyoto. This phenomenon presents a significant challenge for
              the government, which is already grappling with an ageing
              population and a low birth rate.
