          Stormy Daniels To Return To Witness Stand At Trump's Historic Hush
          Money Trial Daniels spent nearly five hours testifying in court on
          Tuesday. (File) New York, United States: Stormy Daniels is to return
          to the witness stand on Thursday at Donald Trump's historic hush money
          trial for another round of expected tough grilling by attorneys for
          the former president. The X-rated film actress, who claims to have had
          sex with the married Trump in 2006, spent nearly five hours testifying
          on Tuesday, recounting the incident in often explicit detail as the
          real estate tycoon sat stewing just feet away. Trump, 77, is accused
          of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen,
          for a $130,000 payment made to Daniels on the eve of the 2016
          presidential election, when the lurid story of marital infidelity
          could have sunk his campaign against Hillary Clinton.The extraordinary
          courtroom face-off between Daniels and Trump is taking place six
          months before the November election when the Republican hopeful will
          try to defeat Democratic President Joe Biden.Speaking at a machine-gun
          pace that had the judge telling her to slow down at times, Daniels
          walked the New York jury through the one-night stand she said she had
          with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament.Merchan also called Trump's
          lawyers to the bench at one point to complain that the ex-president
          was "cursing audibly".
