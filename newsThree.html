          Japan is confronting a significant problem with vacant houses,
          reaching a record of nine million - exceeding the population of New
          York City. This surge is directly linked to the country's declining
          population, according to a report by CNN. Traditionally, abandoned
          houses, known as "akiya," were found primarily in rural areas.
          However, the trend is spreading to major cities like Tokyo and Kyoto.
          This phenomenon presents a significant challenge for the government,
          which is already grappling with an ageing population and a low birth
          rate. Experts like Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of
          International Studies, emphasise that the abundance of empty homes
          isn't due to excessive construction. Instead, it's a stark reflection
          of Japan's shrinking population. There simply aren't enough people to
          fill the existing houses.As per data gathered by the Ministry of
          Internal Affairs and Communications, 14% of Japan's residential
          properties stand vacant. This encompasses not only second homes but
          also properties left unoccupied for various reasons, such as owners
          temporarily relocating abroad for work.Akiya are often passed down
          through generations. But with Japan's plummeting fertility rate, many
          are left with no heir to pass to or are inherited by younger
          generations who have moved to the cities and see little value in
          returning to rural areas, experts told CNN.
